# Day 1 (monday 15-01)
* Created a login screen and fixed email/password authentication. 
* Provided proper error alerts at login screen.
* Sign up function is also active. Signing up a new account will send user data to the database, all attributes of a profile are set now.
* Started working on Facebook Login authentication.
* The design of the login screen is inspirated by the login screen below (found on Google Images)

* Managed to load the daily AND weekly top 10 users(!) with their scores (descending) from the user database.
* Started to work on saving user data when new account is created with Facebook login.

# Day 4 (thursday 18-01)

## Things I still have to implement in my app:

* Actually do something when timer ends
* Provide feedback when question is answered (or not answered)
* Save fetched questions in database, so that every user gets the same questions
* Get local time to reset daily points every day
* Complete list of decode entities
