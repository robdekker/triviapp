# PROJECT

**Title:** Triviapp  
**Name:** Rob Dekker  
**Summary:** Compete with your friends in this trivia game every single week of the year.  


## Problem statement
With current trivia games you can’t compete with other users with something at stake. There is a leaderboard, but you can’t really win something. This mobile application is made for people who love to play a game at which there is more at stake than “just” honour.

*Solution*  
In some way I want to implement a function with which users can determine if they want to play for some sort of “price”. Every day of the week users are able to answer N (still undefined) questions. There is a leaderboard where every user can see their current ranking and the top 10 users with their scores. At the end of each week there can only be one winner. Apart from that, users are not able to “cheat” with in-app purchases, so it will be a fair battle.
