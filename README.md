**Title:** Triviapp  
**Name:** Rob Dekker  
**Summary:** Compete with your friends in this trivia game every single week of the year.  


## Description
With current trivia games you can’t compete with other users on a daily basis. There is a leaderboard, but you can’t really win something. This mobile application is made for people who love to play a game at which there is more at stake than “just” honour.

*Solution*  
Every day of the week users are able to answer 10 questions. These questions are for every user the same. There is a leaderboard where every user can see the daily top 10 and weekly top 10 users with their corresponding scores. At the end of each week there can only be one winner! Apart from that, users are not able to “cheat” with in-app purchases, so it will be a fair battle.
